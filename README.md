# Keras Library Cheatseat
Built on top of TensorFlow 2.0, Keras is an industry-strength framework that can scale to large clusters of GPUs or an entire TPU pod. It's not only possible; it's easy.
Keras is an API designed for human beings, not machines. Keras follows best practices for reducing cognitive load: it offers consistent & simple APIs, it minimizes the number of user actions required for common use cases, and it provides clear & actionable error messages. It also has extensive documentation and developer guides.
